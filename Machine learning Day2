#Data Representation
#scikit-learn works with 2d arrays or matrices for input data('X') and 1d arrays for target variable('y')
import numpy as np
from sklearn import datasets

#load a dataset

iris=datasets.load_iris()
X=iris.data
y=iris.target
print(X[1][1])
print(y[0])
print(X[:5])
print(y[:5])
output
